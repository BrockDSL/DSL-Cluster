## Cluster Computing for Humans

The Brock University Digital Scholarship Lab now has access to a distributed computing array!  This means that we have multiple computers connected together and can have them all work together on a singular task.

We currently have 38 computers (called nodes in the world of high perfance computing) connected together to provide 152 cores worth of processing power!

If you have a project that you think could benefit from a large amount of processing power or if you have any questions please come visit us at the Digital Scholarship Lab in the Rankin Family Pavilion or e-mail us at dsl@brocku.ca
